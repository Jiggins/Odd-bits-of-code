{-  Haskell without the Haskell
    This was just a little experiment to see if I it was possible to write the 
    quicksort algorithm in Haskell without using any of the standard library 
    functions, including <=, > and even $.  I reimplemented all of the 
    functions, classes and instances needed for quicksort.
